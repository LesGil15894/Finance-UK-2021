                        <h2>What Does a Day Trader Do?</h2>
                        <p>A day trader actively buys and sells securities, often multiple times during the day, but without carrying any open positions to the next day. All buy and sell positions taken during a trading day are squared off on the same day before the market closes. Day traders are different from active traders who may hold a position for multiple days, or from investors who invest for longer periods. Day traders also use leverage to increase their intraday trade exposure.</p><br>
                        
                        <h3>1. Conduct a Self-Assessment</h3>
                        <p>Successful day trading requires a combination of knowledge, skills, and traits as well as a commitment to a lifestyle. Are you adept with mathematical analysis, full of financial knowledge, aware of behavioral psychology (in yourself as well as others), and do you have the stomach for entrepreneurship? Contrary to the perceived notion of an easy life or easy money, day trading actually requires:</p><br>
                        
                            <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
                            <li>Long working hours</li>
                            <li>Very little leave from work</li>
                            <li>Continuous self-learning with no guidance</li>
                            <li>Risk-taking abilities</li>
                            <li>Never-ending commitment to daily activities of the job</li>
                            </ul>

                        <p>The right mindset is the most important (and the very first) requirement in becoming a day trader. Unless you are prepared to devote time, self-learn, and be mentally prepared to take risks and suffer losses, do not try day trading. Books like Trade Your Way to Financial Freedom by Van K. Tharp and The Psychology of Trading by Brett N. Steenbarger are good resources for learning more about day trading and performing a self-assessment.</p><br>
                        
                        <h3>2. Understand the Markets</h3>
                        <p>Day traders need a solid foundation of knowledge about how the markets function. From simple details (like exchange trading hours and holidays) to complex details (like the impact of news events, margin requirements, and allowed tradable instruments), a trader needs to have a broad knowledge base. </p><br>
                        
                        <h3>3. Practice Money Management</h3>
                        <p>Let’s say you have $100,000 as trading capital and an excellent trading strategy that offers a 70% success rate (seven trades out of 10 are profitable). How much should you spend on your first trade? What if the first three trades are a failure? What if the average record (seven profitable trades out of 10) no longer holds? Or, while trading futures (or options), how should you allocate your capital to margin money requirements?</p><br>
                        <p>Money management helps you address these challenges and estimate your potential profitability. Effective money management can help you win even if there are only four profitable trades out of 10. Practice, plan, and structure the trades according to a designated money management and capital allocation plan. </p><br>
                        
                        <h3>4. Start Small and Then Expand</h3>
                        <p>Even if you have sufficient money and sufficient experience, don’t play big on the first trades of a new strategy. Try out a new strategy with a smaller amount and increase the stakes after tasting success. Remember, markets and trading opportunities will remain forever, but money, once lost, may be difficult to reaccumulate. Start small, test to establish, and then go for the big ones.</p><br>
                        
                        <h3>5. Arrange Sufficient Capital</h3>
                        <p>No one can generate profits consistently. Intermittent and extended losses are part of the day trading game. (For example, a day trader may suffer eight loss-making trades in a row and only recover with profit on the ninth trade.)</p><br>
                        <p>To handle these risks, a day trader must have a sufficient cushion of capital. As Van K. Tharp explained in Trade Your Way to Financial Freedom, entering the trading world with only a small amount of money is a sure path to failure. Before quitting your job to trade full time, Tharp recommends having at least $100,000 for trading. Novices can start with smaller amounts, depending upon their selected trading plan, the frequency of trading, and other costs they bear. To actively day trade, it is required that you maintain a balance of $25,000 in your trading account.</p><br>
                        
                        <h3>The Bottom Line</h3>
                        <p>Aspiring traders should beware of websites and courses that promise foolproof day trading success or endless profits. The limited percentage of day traders who have managed to be successful do so by investing their time and efforts into building trading strategies and following them religiously.</p><br>
