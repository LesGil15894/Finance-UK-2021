						<p>You may feel that the spending hours at the mall, coffee shops and through television are endless and you simply have no money or no debt to pay off the credit card bills. Other people will surely feel the same way and will want to solve their debt problems.

                        You may resist the urge to open your wallet because you may be full of stress with all that you owe and you can't seem to take out your money for life. Instead of listening to people who say they can help, you might consider getting a part time job to make extra money to pay off your debts. You may also think the stimulus plan is a requirement, but you can take advantage of your tax return for some relief that you can pay back to the credit card companies.

                        If you don't have any extra money to pay off the bills, you may yet still want to look for help. While you're searching, you may also learn about another stimulus package that the credit card companies have for you. You may want to take advantage of this and get out of debt now because the recession may be here to stay.

                        In this type of economic climate, it can be hard to find a job and it can also be hard to find a home to live in. It can be especially hard on individuals and families who have been urging for nothing less than the American dream. You may be that many already - and you may even just be looking for a change and want to get through this without having to worry about losing what you have begun.

                        You may find that your bank may allow you to receive a free or cheap 2-year checking account and that you may also be eligible for overdraft protection. This means that if you're short of money and the account goes below zero, you may have an additional avenue of credit at your disposal. For example, the money is still not available and you can't use it so you may want to use this. You may think now that you're becoming a tobacco dealer as well as dealing in illegal drugs!

                        While it may not seem like it, you actually have a lot of control over your finances and it may not hurt to take a breath before things get out of hand. For those who can exercise some self control and still stand before the scrutiny of the Internal Revenue Service after they have loosed a bank account or borrowed money may just be a good time for you to consider getting a second job. Working a second job may not provide the same benefits as putting your head down for one day at a time, but then you don't have to deal with compromise of funding any less important purchases after paying the bills.

                        If you're in over your head, you'll have to seek professional advice in order to find the correct solution to help you. It may be a credit card, consumer credit counseling agency or even bankruptcy lawyer. Because of the economy, these costs are going up and so are the number of people who are in debt. Who better to help with these people when they don't want to go broke?
