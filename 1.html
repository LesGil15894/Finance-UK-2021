						<p>Contrary to popular belief, building wealth and erasing debt is very possible. You don't have to wait for a long time or be one of the most financially knowledgeable. You just have to get started and start improving your finances. Below are 5 steps to personal financial success.</p>

                        <p>1. Save at least 10% of your income. At first, say at least 10%. Then adjust it as necessary. (For example, save $500.00 and at the beginning of the year you are good to go out and save $1000.00. As time goes on and you continue to save, more money can be saved. The 10% is just a target. If it's too hard to put $10.00 into a savings account every month, then you need to look at other ways to save.)</p>

                        <p>2. Become a great shopper. I know this sounds a little crazy, but shop in the used, consumer minded, and budget store. We make contact with people in the consumer world and you never know what you will find. The same goes for the used and budget stores. (Make a list and chips, place in your fridge, and never shop emotionlessly again.)</p>

                        <p>3. Be a great saver. If you say you don't have the money to save, forget it. You need to have faith and above all else work towards your goal. If you want to save $10.00 a day, $50.00 a week, $1000.00 a month goal is attainable and is very doable. Let's take a look at some easy ways:</p>

                        <p>If you are having a tough time getting started or have trouble saving, don't be afraid to call or email me. Get a great financial planner, get online and start a free blog, or get involved on forums looking for resources.</p>

                        <p>5. Enjoy your life. This leads me to number four.</p>

                        <p>4. Enjoy your work. Having a great work ethic is vital to your success. No matter how much you would like to build wealth over night, it doesn't happen. Work is where your income is based on, the dollars are made and then you either make them or lose them. This is not your fault, or the fault of your co-workers. You both get paid the same, but in the end all that matters is how much of it you make. Taking advantage of working in a hobby or business that is in demand would maximize your income.</p>

                        <p>(Remember, you can have terrible bosses and all of the ridiculous company politics and still get the job done.)</p>

                        <p>3. Never quit. These days it is extremely hard to get ahead. If you are one of those people that decide "I can't succeed at this job" never give up. There are tons of areas you can improve in. Just keep at it and never give up. You may want to consider working in something you really want to do for a long time so you have no tears and problems.</p>

                        <p>2. Education is the key. To increase your income and to drastically increase your wealth over time, you need to focus on your education and aim to increase your knowledge in a particular area. Never stop learning!</p>

                        <p>1. If you got through this article, I am guessing that you are at least somewhat interested in becoming wealthy. That is good.</p>

                        <p>Good luck!</p>
